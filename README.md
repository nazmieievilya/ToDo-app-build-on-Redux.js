# Redux ToDo App

This project I`ve build using Redux state manager and styled with Bootstrap, Framer Motion libraries. 

## What I've learned

There are a lot of technologies which can be handy and useful while building React websites, such as:

## `Bootstrap`

It`s a library that provides ready to use components and css-classes. In this project Ive imported progressbar, buttons and pop-up forms. That allows to make appearance of application more satisfying and spend more time and energy on developing functionality

## `Framer Motion`

This is another React library, but it is specialized in animation. You can make really brilliant and splendid animation in a second—ã with such benefits as above(spend more time and energy on functionality)

## `Styled Components`

Another one library that may be very useful if you want to make your website interactive and don`t want to prepare extra css-files

## `Redux`

**Functionality**

I saw a lot of ToDo apps as pet-projects but I decided to expand their functionality and add more interactive components, such requirements need state management and Redux the most popular solution. It also has its own browser plugin (Redux Toolkit) that brings opportunity to see changes of  state graphs and objects in real time
